# Kaggle Notebooks 📝
![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/project-notebooks-blue)

Whenever I want to make reference to the code use for the [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) competitions I joined and some great notebooks I discovered on the platform, it takes time to load the webpage on Kaggle and the notebooks are everywhere. 

Storing the notebooks on GitHub provides the ease of access to these notebooks and also the notebooks can be stored locally for easy viewing. ✌️
